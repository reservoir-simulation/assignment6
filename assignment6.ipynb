Essentially, the goal is to minimize the error between an assumed model (in this case the K-C model) and the data.  After some derivations, this leads to the following matrix-vector equation\n",

For solving the linear system of equations, see [`numpy.linalg.solve()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html).  Also, matrix-vector dot products are carried out using the [`numpy.dot()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html)"
